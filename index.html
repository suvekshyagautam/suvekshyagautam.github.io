<!-- ================== Research ================== -->
## 📚 Research

### Gender-Differentiated Labor Market Effects of Industry Shocks  
I estimate the differential impact of male- and female-weighted wage shocks on local labor markets. Using a shift-share instrument and TWFE regression, I find substantial gender heterogeneity in district-level labor outcomes.

### Experimental Work on Strategic Decision-Making  
I’m running an experiment comparing two strategically similar games to examine how perceived question similarity affects participant behavior. This work informs experimental design for policy applications.
